# About
DBApproachSelenium is a Database-driven Selenium Test Automation Framework built with C# and NUnit.
The framework is designed to fetch test data directly from the database instead of hardcoding it, ensuring better scalability and maintainability of test cases.
Key Highlights:
1.Database Driven Testing (DDT): Uses DBHelper.cs and DBreader.cs to connect and fetch test data.

2.Modular Setup:

Setup/ → Contains base classes (Base.cs, Basefunction.cs) to initialize WebDriver and common utilities.
Reporting/ → Handles test reporting with Reporting.cs.
Testcase/ → Includes individual test case files (e.g., AddAdmin.cs, AddEmployee.cs, Login.cs, etc.).
Testcall/ → Manages execution entry points (Test.cs).

3.Scalable Test Management: Each test case is independent and retrieves data dynamically.

4.Reporting Integration: Generates structured execution reports.

# Usecases
This project is ideal for teams who want to:

Run automated tests with real-time DB-driven data.

Maintain test cases in a modular way.

Generate clear execution reports.
